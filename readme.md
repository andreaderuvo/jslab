Mission: try to reuse as much as possible the techniques explained in the course at https://github.com/andreaderuvo/jscourse.

1. Build a web component that shows a todo from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos. 
   It should contain a button to delete the todo.
   On click, it saves the todo's _id_ in _localStorage_.

2. Build a web component that's a collection of todos (reuse 1). It should not show the removed todos.

3. It should be reactive between tabs.
